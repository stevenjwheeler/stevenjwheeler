Hi, I'm Steven! ðŸ˜Š

I'm from the UK and recently graduated from University with a First in Computer Science (Cyber Security).

I have learnt to program in C, C++, C#, XAML, Python, JavaScript, Node.JS, SQL, HTML and CSS, either self-taught or in University, and have created  Console apps, Universal Windows Platform apps, Cross-platform PC applications, Windows Form apps, Scripts, Discord bots, etc.

### Some notable projects

#### PassDefend
I created a Localized Password Manager that still has advanced security features for my Final Year Project in university. It will probably not see much more development, but is pretty advanced in its development and has some nifty features.
You can check out this project on my website [here](https://www.stevenwheeler.co.uk/passdefend), or check out the [repo](https://www.github.com/robotprobot/passdefend).

#### QuestEyes
I am currently working on QuestEyes - a large project where the goal is to create a physical hardware device with embedded firmware that connects to an application on a PC. The project is ongoing, and the goal is to create Eye Tracking technology using machine vision, which can fit into VR headsets or take other forms of hardware to allow interaction with devices! See my [QuestEyes organisation](https://github.com/questeyes) for more!

#### EasyDiscordBotBase
I have created a quick Discord bot base that allows people to hit the ground running when creating Discord bots that use slash commands and Discord.JS 14. It allows community members to create their own modules, share them with each other and easily install or create features for their bot. Check out the [repo](https://www.github.com/robotprobot/easydiscordbotbase).
