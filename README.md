I'm from the UK and have been programming for many years.
First and foremost, I'm a tinkerer. I mess around with coding and create little (and some larger) projects when I think of them, but mainly I am a university student studying Computer Science (Cyber Security pathway).

I have created Discord bots, Windows Form apps, Console apps, Universal Windows Platform apps, Scripts, etc.

The biggest project that I am currently working on is a Localized Password Manager that still has advanced security features whilst allowing the user to keep control of their data. You can check out this project at https://www.stevenwheeler.co.uk/passdefend, or check out the roadmap [here](https://view.monday.com/1409325826-39e46f5daf0234e1b1ff2e005269dfe6?r=use1).

My favourite language at the moment is JavaScript/NodeJS!

Thanks for viewing my profile, and have a look at my repositories! [Note; my university assignments are currently in private repositories]
