Hi, I'm Steven! ðŸ‘‹

I'm from the UK and recently graduated from University with a First in Computer Science (Cyber Security).

I have learnt to program in C, C++, C#, XAML, Python, JavaScript, Node.JS, SQL, HTML and CSS, either self-taught or in University, and have created Discord bots, Windows Form apps, Console apps, Universal Windows Platform apps, Scripts, etc.

I created a Localized Password Manager that still has advanced security features for my Final Year Project in university.
You can check out this project on my website [here](https://www.stevenwheeler.co.uk/passdefend), or check out the [repo](https://www.github.com/robotprobot/passdefend).

I am currently working on another very large project where the goal is to create a physical hardware device with embedded firmware that connects to an application on a PC. See my QuestEyes repos for more!

Thanks for viewing my profile, and have a look at my repositories!
