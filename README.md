Hi, I'm Steven! ðŸ‘‹

I'm from the UK and recently graduated from University with a First in Computer Science (Cyber Security).

I have learnt to program in C, C++, C#, XAML, Python, JavaScript, Node.JS, SQL, HTML and CSS, either self-taught or in University, and have created Discord bots, Windows Form apps, Console apps, Universal Windows Platform apps, Scripts, etc.

The biggest project that I am currently working on is a Localized Password Manager that still has advanced security features whilst allowing the user to keep control of their data. You can check out this project here.

Thanks for viewing my profile, and have a look at my repositories!
